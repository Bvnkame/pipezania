Editor
You need to set in the init.coffee the level you want to edit.
eg window.editor = 4. To save your layout you need to start the flow.
When you get the clear screen it saves the layout.

Ideas:

* A pipe on the other edge of the map can connect to another
pipe to the outer edge.

* pipes that can be transformed into other pipe types

* triggers on pipes that cause other pipes to rotate

* triggers that cause other pipes to vanish
